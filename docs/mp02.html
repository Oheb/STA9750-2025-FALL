<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In today’s housing landscape, there exists little room for affordability, let alone availability, amongst those who wish to become new homeowners. This can be attributed to the ever changing conditions and perpetually rising thresholds it takes to comfortably maintain a permanent presence in America’s most desirable locations (large metropolitan areas). In this project, we will analyze the various factors and roadblocks that are causing this crisis using datasets sourced from the Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS), and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) that span the last 15 years. This analysis examines how housing development in metropolitan areas and income trends amongst the general populace influence societal factors such as rent burden, population growth, and housing development in the United States. To identify cities that demonstrate the “YIMBY” (Yes In My Backyard) movement, or willing to build more affordable housing, R-based analytical methods will applied to both scrutinize and display the aforementioned housing and societal trends that are occurring in the nation’s top combined statistical areas (CBSA).</p>

<h1>Task 7: Policy Brief: The Pro Growth Housing Incentives Act:</h1>
<section id="action-objective-securing-sponsors-and-core-support" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="action-objective-securing-sponsors-and-core-support">Action Objective: Securing Sponsors and Core Support</h2>
<p>The Pro-Growth Housing Incentives Act is a national grant program designed to reward and incentivize local zoning reform, boost housing supply, and lowering the Rent Burden Index (RBI) nationwide, with the end goal being to make housing affordable long term in all major CBSAs nationwide.</p>
</section>
<section id="congressional-sponsorship-strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="congressional-sponsorship-strategy">Congressional Sponsorship Strategy</h2>
<p>To maximize support, we must pair a sponsor whose success is proof of the program’s theory with a co-sponsor whose crisis underscores its necessity in CBSAs that demonstrate model strengths and shortcomings that this bill aims to solve.</p>
<section id="primary-sponsoring-area-pro-growth-cbsa-26420-houston-sugar-land-baytown-tx" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="primary-sponsoring-area-pro-growth-cbsa-26420-houston-sugar-land-baytown-tx">Primary Sponsoring Area (Pro Growth CBSA): 26420, Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX</h3>
<p>Houston demonstrates the power of pro-supply policies. Their Rent Burden Index (RBI) decreased (from 1.05 to 1.04) despite massive population growth, thanks to a high Housing Growth Score (HGS) of 1.56 (56% above the national average). The Act will allow Houston to scale its success and continue growing with ample housing to provide.</p>
</section>
<section id="co-sponsoring-area-advocate-cbsa-this-bill-aims-to-solve-41940-san-jose-sunnyvale-santa-clara-ca" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="co-sponsoring-area-advocate-cbsa-this-bill-aims-to-solve-41940-san-jose-sunnyvale-santa-clara-ca">Co-sponsoring Area (Advocate CBSA this bill aims to solve): 41940, San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA</h3>
<p>San Jose is the prime example of the crisis this bill solves. The city’s RBI has risen dramatically from 2009-2023 (from 1.52 to 1.63), coupled with a low HGS of just 0.58. The Act offers the necessary resources and incentives to break decades of systemic supply failure in Silicon Valley’s most populated area.</p>

<section id="building-momentum-through-securing-support" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-momentum-through-securing-support">Building Momentum through Securing Support</h2>
<p>Securing support from local labor and trade unions is universally critical for passage in CBSAs nationwide. This bill specifically benefits two vocally engaged groups in society by focusing on jobs and cost relief that can flourish under this act.</p>
<section id="group-1-construction-building-unions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-1-construction-building-unions">Group 1: Construction &amp; Building Unions</h3>
<p>This Act provides funding directly tied to local permit reform and increased housing unit construction. This means immediate, stable, high-wage union and trade jobs in both metros and eventually nationwide. For San Jose, it means jump-starting a lagging housing sector. For Houston, it means federal support to maintain their current building boom.</p>
</section>
<section id="group-2-service-industry-workers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-2-service-industry-workers">Group 2: Service Industry Workers</h3>
<p>For low and mid-wage workers-often the first victims of rising housing costs—The Act delivers meaningful economic relief amidst the changing landscape across America. By increasing housing supply (as seen in Houston’s stabilized RBI), we drive down the largest monthly expense-Rent. This effectively acts as a raise or tax cut, leaving service workers with more disposable income, which, in turn, boosts local businesses like restaurants and retail (where they also may work, thus providing a stronger sense of job security for those holding these positions).</p>

<section id="targeting-funding-efficiently-across-cbsas" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="targeting-funding-efficiently-across-cbsas">Targeting Funding Efficiently Across CBSAs</h2>
<p>To define “YIMBY” success and in turn allocate funds in an appropriate manner proportionately nationwide, This Act uses two symbiotic indices:</p>
<section id="rent-burden-index-rbi" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rent-burden-index-rbi">Rent Burden Index (RBI):</h3>
<p>What it measures: Housing affordability stress, or the arbitrary threshold needed to live comfortably. It calculates the average annual rent relative to the average income in a given area.</p>
<p>What is ‘Good’: A city is succeeding if its RBI is decreasing over time. This means housing is becoming more affordable relative to local wages, proving supply is meeting demand.</p>
</section>
<section id="housing-growth-score-hgs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="housing-growth-score-hgs">Housing Growth Score (HGS):</h3>
<p>What it measures: The effectiveness and ambition of new housing construction in a given area. It combines raw permits per capita (Housing Growth Intensity) with permits relative to population change (Housing Growth Responsiveness).</p>
<p>What is ‘Good’: A city is succeeding if its HGS is above the national average. This proves the city isn’t just growing, but is proactively changing zoning restrictions and ensuring future supply meets population need.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This plans to reward cities that use the Housing Growth Score System to lower the Rent Burden Index that plagues their populus through providing assistance and incentives to cities that have a high RBI and a low HGS, giving them a clear path toward federal grant eligibility and eventually affordable and available housing for all.</p>
